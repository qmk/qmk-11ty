<h2 id="what-is-qmk%3F" tabindex="-1">What is QMK?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qmk">QMK</a>, short for Quantum Mechanical Keyboard, is a group of people building tools for custom keyboards. We started with the <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK firmware</a>, a heavily modified fork of <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard">TMK</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-don't-know-where-to-start!" tabindex="-1">I don't know where to start!</h2>
<p>If this is the case, then you should start with our <a href="newbs.md">Newbs Guide</a>. There is a lot of great info there, and that should cover everything you need to get started.</p>
<p>If that's an issue, hop onto the <a href="https://config.qmk.fm">QMK Configurator</a>, as that will handle a majority of what you need there.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-flash-the-firmware-i-built%3F" tabindex="-1">How can I flash the firmware I built?</h2>
<p>First, head to the <a href="faq_build.md">Compiling/Flashing FAQ Page</a>. There is a good deal of info there, and you'll find a bunch of solutions to common issues there.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-have-an-issue-that-isn't-covered-here%3F" tabindex="-1">What if I have an issue that isn't covered here?</h2>
<p>Okay, that's fine. Then please check the <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues">open issues in our GitHub</a> to see if somebody is experiencing the same thing (make sure it's not just similar, but actually the same).</p>
<p>If you can't find anything, then please open a <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/new">new issue</a>!</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-found-a-bug%3F" tabindex="-1">What if I found a bug?</h2>
<p>Then please open an <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/new">issue</a>, and if you know how to fix it, open up a Pull Request on GitHub with the fix.</p>
<h2 id="but-git-and-github-are-intimidating!" tabindex="-1">But <code>git</code> and <code>GitHub</code> are intimidating!</h2>
<p>Don't worry, we have some pretty nice <a href="newbs_git_best_practices.md">Guidelines</a> on how to start using <code>git</code> and GitHub to make things easier to develop.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can find additional <code>git</code> and GitHub related links <a href="newbs_learn_more_resources.md">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-have-a-keyboard-that-i-want-to-add-support-for" tabindex="-1">I have a Keyboard that I want to add support for</h2>
<p>Awesome! Open up a Pull Request for it. We'll review the code, and merge it!</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-want-to-brand-it-with-qmk%3F" tabindex="-1">What if I want to brand it with <code>QMK</code>?</h3>
<p>That's amazing! We would love to assist you with that!</p>
<p>In fact, we have a <a href="https://qmk.fm/powered/">whole page</a> dedicated to adding QMK Branding to your page and keyboard. This covers pretty much everything you need (knowledge and images) to officially support QMK.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this, open an issue or head to <a href="https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh">Discord</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-differences-are-there-between-qmk-and-tmk%3F" tabindex="-1">What Differences Are There Between QMK and TMK?</h2>
<p>TMK was originally designed and implemented by <a href="https://github.com/tmk">Jun Wako</a>. QMK started as <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert">Jack Humbert</a>'s fork of TMK for the Planck. After a while Jack's fork had diverged quite a bit from TMK, and in 2015 Jack decided to rename his fork to QMK.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint QMK builds upon TMK by adding several new features. Most notably QMK has expanded the number of available keycodes and uses these to implement advanced features like <code>S()</code>, <code>LCTL()</code>, and <code>MO()</code>. You can see a complete list of these keycodes in <a href="keycodes.md">Keycodes</a>.</p>
<p>From a project and community management standpoint TMK maintains all the officially supported keyboards by himself, with a bit of community support. Separate community maintained forks exist or can be created for other keyboards. Only a few keymaps are provided by default, so users typically don't share keymaps with each other. QMK encourages sharing of both keyboards and keymaps through a centrally managed repository, accepting all pull requests that follow the quality standards. These are mostly community maintained, but the QMK team also helps when necessary.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their merits and their drawbacks, and code flows freely between TMK and QMK when it makes sense.</p>
