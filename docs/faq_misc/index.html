<h2 id="how-do-i-test-my-keyboard%3F-%3Aid%3Dtesting" tabindex="-1">How do I test my keyboard? :id=testing</h2>
<p>Testing your keyboard is usually pretty straightforward. Press every single key and make sure it sends the keys you expect. You can use <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/test/">QMK Configurator</a>'s test mode to check your keyboard, even if it doesn't run QMK.</p>
<h2 id="safety-considerations" tabindex="-1">Safety Considerations</h2>
<p>You probably don't want to &quot;brick&quot; your keyboard, making it impossible
to rewrite firmware onto it.  Here are some of the parameters to show
what things are (and likely aren't) too risky.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your keyboard map does not include RESET, then, to get into DFU
mode, you will need to press the reset button on the PCB, which
requires unscrewing the bottom.</li>
<li>Messing with tmk_core / common files might make the keyboard
inoperable</li>
<li>Too large a .hex file is trouble; <code>make dfu</code> will erase the block,
test the size (oops, wrong order!), which errors out, failing to
flash the keyboard, leaving it in DFU mode.
<ul>
<li>To this end, note that the maximum .hex file size on e.g. Planck
is 7000h (28672 decimal)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Linking: .build/planck_rev4_cbbrowne.elf                                                            [OK]
Creating load file for Flash: .build/planck_rev4_cbbrowne.hex                                       [OK]

Size after:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      0   22396       0   22396    577c planck_rev4_cbbrowne.hex
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The above file is of size 22396/577ch, which is less than
28672/7000h</li>
<li>As long as you have a suitable alternative .hex file around, you
can retry, loading that one</li>
<li>Some of the options you might specify in your keyboard's Makefile
consume extra memory; watch out for BOOTMAGIC_ENABLE,
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE, EXTRAKEY_ENABLE, CONSOLE_ENABLE</li>
<li>DFU tools do /not/ allow you to write into the bootloader (unless
you throw in an extra fruit salad of options), so there is little risk
there.</li>
<li>EEPROM has around a 100000 (100k) write cycle.  You shouldn't rewrite
the firmware repeatedly and continually; that'll burn the EEPROM
eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nkro-doesn't-work" tabindex="-1">NKRO Doesn't work</h2>
<p>First you have to compile firmware with the build option <code>NKRO_ENABLE</code> in <strong>Makefile</strong>.</p>
<p>Try <code>Magic</code> <strong>N</strong> command(<code>LShift+RShift+N</code> by default) when <strong>NKRO</strong> still doesn't work. You can use this command to toggle between <strong>NKRO</strong> and <strong>6KRO</strong> mode temporarily. In some situations <strong>NKRO</strong> doesn't work and you will need to switch to <strong>6KRO</strong> mode, in particular when you are in BIOS.</p>
<h2 id="trackpoint-needs-reset-circuit-(ps%2F2-mouse-support)" tabindex="-1">TrackPoint Needs Reset Circuit (PS/2 Mouse Support)</h2>
<p>Without reset circuit you will have inconsistent result due to improper initialization of the hardware. See circuit schematic of TPM754:</p>

<h2 id="can't-read-column-of-matrix-beyond-16" tabindex="-1">Can't Read Column of Matrix Beyond 16</h2>
<p>Use <code>1UL&lt;&lt;16</code> instead of <code>1&lt;&lt;16</code> in <code>read_cols()</code> in [matrix.h] when your columns goes beyond 16.</p>
<p>In C <code>1</code> means one of [int] type which is [16 bit] in case of AVR, so you can't shift left more than 15. Thus, calculating <code>1&lt;&lt;16</code> will unexpectedly equal zero. To work around this, you have to use [unsigned long] type with <code>1UL</code>.</p>

<h2 id="special-extra-key-doesn't-work-(system%2C-audio-control-keys)" tabindex="-1">Special Extra Key Doesn't Work (System, Audio Control Keys)</h2>
<p>You need to define <code>EXTRAKEY_ENABLE</code> in <code>rules.mk</code> to use them in QMK.</p>
<pre><code>EXTRAKEY_ENABLE = yes          # Audio control and System control
</code></pre>
<h2 id="wake-from-sleep-doesn't-work" tabindex="-1">Wake from Sleep Doesn't Work</h2>
<p>In Windows check <code>Allow this device to wake the computer</code> setting in <strong>Power Management</strong> property tab of <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Also check your BIOS settings. Pressing any key during sleep should wake host.</p>
<h2 id="using-arduino%3F" tabindex="-1">Using Arduino?</h2>
<p><strong>Note that Arduino pin naming is different from actual chip.</strong> For example, Arduino pin <code>D0</code> is not <code>PD0</code>. Check circuit with its schematics yourself.</p>

<li>https://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-micro-schematic.pdf</li>
</ul>
<p>Arduino Leonardo and micro have <strong>ATMega32U4</strong> and can be used for TMK, though Arduino bootloader may be a problem.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-jtag" tabindex="-1">Enabling JTAG</h2>
<p>By default, the JTAG debugging interface is disabled as soon as the keyboard starts up. JTAG-capable MCUs come from the factory with the <code>JTAGEN</code> fuse set, and it takes over certain pins of the MCU that the board may be using for the switch matrix, LEDs, etc.</p>
<p>If you would like to keep JTAG enabled, just add the following to your <code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c"><span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">define</span> <span class="token macro-name">NO_JTAG_DISABLE</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="usb-3-compatibility" tabindex="-1">USB 3 Compatibility</h2>
<p>Some problems can be fixed by switching from a USB 3.x port to a USB 2.0 port.</p>
<h2 id="mac-compatibility" tabindex="-1">Mac Compatibility</h2>

<h2 id="problem-in-bios-(uefi)-setup%2Fresume-(sleep-%26-wake)%2Fpower-cycles" tabindex="-1">Problem in BIOS (UEFI) Setup/Resume (Sleep &amp; Wake)/Power Cycles</h2>
<p>Some people reported their keyboard stops working in BIOS and/or after resume(power cycles).</p>
<p>As of now the root cause is not clear, but some build options seem to be related. In Makefile, try to disable options like <code>CONSOLE_ENABLE</code>, <code>NKRO_ENABLE</code>, <code>SLEEP_LED_ENABLE</code> and/or others.</p>
